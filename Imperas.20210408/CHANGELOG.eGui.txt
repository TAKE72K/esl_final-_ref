- The eGui_Eclipse package is now based on Eclipse version 202003. If needed,  
  the previous Eclipse version, Neon, is available in the
  eGui_Eclipse_neon_legacy package.
- If both versions are installed, the eGui.202003 will be invoked by default 
  when egui.exe or the --mpdegui command line option are used. To override this, 
  install the eGui_Eclipse_neon_legacy package and set the IMPERAS_EGUI_DIR 
  environment variable to eGui.neon.
- If running on a true 32 bit system (i.e. a 32 bit OS, not a 64 bit OS using 
  32 bit compatibility mode) the you must use the eGui_Eclipse_neon_legacy
  package.
- Updated the jre provided with eGui to OpenJDK version jdk8u265-b01-jre for
  all architectures except Linux32.

EGit plugin included in eguieclipse
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EGit plugin that supports using git from inside Eclipse is now included
by default in eguieclipse. Previously it was necessary to add this plugin
yourself if it was needed.

- During disassembly, if a gdb fails to recognize an instruction, egui now uses
  the processor model to disassemble the instruction instead. This behaviour
  can be turned off using mpd command 'set mixeddisassembly 0' (in the debug
  console window)

Debug Sources view problem with certain native gdb versions fixed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A problem displaying the Debug Sources view for native code when using the 
Attach Hostcode feature has been fixed. 

Improved behavior after simulation has finished
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When simulation has finished (all processors have exited) eguieclipse will now
gray out the resume/step/... buttons. You may introspect the final state of the 
models at this point.

Filter selection added to Programmers View
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ability to filter what registers are shown has been added to the programmers
view.

Attach Hostcode command moved from Imperas menu to Run menu
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The "Attach Hostcode" command that was formally in the Imperas menu has been
moved to the Run menu (this item is only available in the Debug Perspective.)
Since this was the only item in the Imperas menu, that menu has been removed.

eguieclipse plugin zip file name changed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The name of the eguieclipse plugin zip file has been changed to:
   com.imperas.egui.p2.zip

jre version updated on 64 bit hosts
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The jre included with eGui on 64-bit hosts has been updated to:
   openjdk version "1.8.0-adoptopenjdk"

Added a debug version of the "Imperas- Launch Simulator" run configuration
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The "Imperas- Launch Simulator" run configuration available in the C/C++ 
perspective under "Run->Run Configurations..." now supports a debug version
available under "Run->Debug Configurations...". This allows the user to tell
eguieclipse how to launch a simulation run with a debug session connected to it.

egui.exe startup utility
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The behavior has been changed when the egui.exe startup utility program is used 
in start-only mode to just start eguieclipse without connecting to a simulation, 
(i.e. run with no --cli or --open option selected):
  - No longer will start a new eguieclipse if one is already running.
  - Waits for eguieclipse to successfully startup before returning.
  - Returns a non-zero exit code if eguieclipse does not start successfully.
Previously egui.exe would always start a new eguieclipse in this mode, even if
one was already running, and return as soon as the new eguieclipse process was 
created, without checking if eguieclipse actually started successfully.

Programmers View updates correctly
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A bug has been fixed that caused the Programmers View to sometimes not get
updated when control returned to the debugger.

Module hierarchy now reflected in eGui Debug view
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The eGui Debug view now reflects the hierarchy of the design being simulated.

New Resume Until/For tool bar button added
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A new tool bar button has been added which can be used to easily resume 
execution for a specific number of instructions or seconds or to resume 
execution until a specific instruction count or time.

The icon for the new button looks like the standard Resume (a yellow and green
right arrow 'play' icon) but with a black 'i' on it. 

New Debug Sources view added
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A new  Debug Sources view has been added to eguieclipse. This view shows the
source files known to the debugger, allowing them to then be easily opened in 
the source window. Use Window->Show View->Debug Sources to open this new view.

egui.exe handling of eguieclipse launch failure improved
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Handling of errors that occur when eguieclipse is launched by the egui.exe 
utility program have been improved. Previously egui.exe would time out
waiting for an egui.port file to be created. Now it detects when the 
eguieclipse process has terminated due to an error and terminates itself 
immediately.

Out of memory issue fixed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A problem that could cause eguieclipse to run out of memory when large numbers 
of breakpoints were created and deleted has been fixed.

"Target not available" popup error message fixed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A problem that could result in a popup error message saying "Error: Target not 
available" when a number of step commands were rapidly executed has been fixed. 

Additional file extensions support for functionprofile and linecoverage viewers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following filename extensions are now supported by default:
   functionprofile viewer: .fprof
   linecoverage viewer: .lcov
These are non-standard extensions that are used in some demo scripts. They are 
supported in addition to the standard extensions .iprof and .icov. Note that
users may configure the supported extensions for their workspace using:
   Preferences->General->Editors->File Associations

Programmer's view fonts may be changed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The font used in the Programmer's View for variables now will use the same font 
as other variable displays in Eclipse. It can be changed in:
 Windows->Preferences->General->Appearance->Colors and Fonts->Debug->Variable text font

eguieclipse memory leaks fixed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Several memory leaks have been fixed reducing memory usage in some situations.

eguieclipse breakpoint create/delete race fixed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A bug in Eclipse CDT that could cause an error if a breakpoint was deleted 
immediately after being created has been fixed in eguieclipse. This bug has also
been fixed in Eclipse CDT version 9.5, which is scheduled to be released in 
June 2018. Users wishing to install the eGui plugin in the Eclipse Oxygen 
version should contact Imperas for information on updating to CDT 9.5.

eguieclipse disabled eventpoints bug fixed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A bug in eguieclipse that would cause an eventpoint that was disabled in a debug
session to be active after starting a new debug session using the same workspace
has been fixed. Eventpoints will now remain disabled across debug sessions. 

Viewers for VAP linecoverage and functionprofile added to Imperas eGui Eclipse 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Viewers for the output from the VAP linecoverage and functionprofile tools
have been added to eguieclipse. Opening a file in eGui Eclipse that has a suffix
of .iprof or .icov will open the appropriate viewer (Files may be opened using 
the File->Open File... menu selection or by double clicking on a file in the 
Project Explorer view.)

In addition addition, egui.exe now supports a --open argument as explained 
below.

egui.exe command line arguments
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- egui.exe no longer passes unrecognized arguments to the eguieclipse command
  line. Unrecognized arguments now result in an error message. To pass
  command line arguments to the eguieclipse command line use the --eguioptions
  command line argument of egui.exe. Note that multiple --eguioptions arguments
  are now supported.
  
- The egui.exe user arguments --open, --verbose, --eguioptions and --version 
  may now optionally be specified with a single dash (e.g. -open)
  
- egui.exe now supports the --open argument that can be used to tell eguieclipse
  to open a file for viewing. This is primarily intended to be used for viewing
  functionprofile (*.iprof) and linecoverage (*.icov) results but can be used
  for any file type supported by eguieclipse.

Duplicate breakpoint problem fixed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A bug that could cause multiple duplicate breakpoints to be added in 
multiprocessor simulations has been fixed.    

Problem fixed preventing eguieclipse to be installed as a plugin 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A problem preventing eguieclipse plugin installation has been fixed. Note that
it can only be installed as a plugin in the Eclipse Oxygen version or later and 
it requires CDT to be updated to version 9.5.

Imperas eGui Eclipse updated to the Eclipse Neon version
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Imperas eGui Eclipse product has been updated to use the newer Eclipse Neon
version (previously it was based on Eclipse Luna). Eclipse Neon includes 
numerous bug fixes and enhancements. 

eGui Eclipse now also includes a new Debug Console view that supports command
history. 

egui.exe now supports installation of multiple versions of eGui
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
egui.exe will now look in the following directories (in this order) for the
eguieclipse executable by default:
    $IMPERAS_HOME/lib/$IMPERAS_ARCH/eGui
    $IMPERAS_HOME/lib/$IMPERAS_ARCH/eGui.neon
    $IMPERAS_HOME/lib/$IMPERAS_ARCH/eGui.luna
and will use the first one that it finds. This default behavior can be 
overridden by setting the IMPERAS_EGUI_DIR environment variable to the specific 
version desired (e.g. eGui, eGui.neon or eGui.luna). This is useful to select
a specific version when multiple versions have been installed.

egui.exe closes simulator when error occurs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If egui.exe receives an error indication when attempting to launch eguieclipse
in command line mode it will scan the --cli parameter value to determine if
the simulator is waiting for a port connection from eguieclipse and if so it
will connect to that port and immediately close it. This prevents leaving
the simulator waiting for a debugger connection that is never going to happen.

Variable view fix
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A bug that could cause mpd.exe crashes when the variable view was open on
a PSE has been fixed.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
------------------
Programmers View:
- The rbrk and wbrk fields in the programmers view do not work for application
  processors but do work for PSE processors.
- For PSE processors only, clicking the rbrk and wbrk fields will 
  create/remove eventpoints on the register but the check boxes remain blank.
  These eventpoints do show up in the breakpoints window.

Breakpoint Properties:
- To edit the breakpoint properties use the context menu that is opened by 
  right clicking on the breakpoint and selecting "Breakpoint Properties..."
  from the context menu. Opening the breakpoint properties with ALT-Enter
  opens a different properties menu that is not supported in eGui. Do not use 
  the ALT-Enter method to edit the breakpoint properties!

--gdbcommandfile <fn> option supported when using --gdbegui
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When using the --gdbegui option to launch the eguieclipse debugger the 
--gdbcommandfile option may now be used to specify a file of gdb commands to 
run at the start of simulation. This is the equivalent of typing the command
'source <fn>' in the gdb console window.

--batch <fn> option supported when using --mpdegui
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When using the --mpdegui option to launch the eguieclipse debugger the 
--batch option may now be used to specify a file of mpd commands to 
run at the start of simulation. This is the equivalent of typing the command
'source <fn>' in the gdb console window. Note that the debugger starts out in
tcl mode - use the command '::idebug' in the mpd command file to switch to 
debug mode where gdb commands may be used.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
------------------
Variables view:
- On Windows the variable view and hovering on a variable may sometimes 
  show the message:
     "Error: Failed to execute MI command..."
  in the variable value field. The gdb print command may be used in the mpd 
  console view to see the variable value in this case.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
------------------

Debug View:
- When a breakpoint is hit the instance corresponding to where the breakpoint 
  occurred is not always automatically selected. You can examine the status  
  info listed for each ID to find the one that indicates "breakpoint". (The 
  status is shown in parentheses at the end of the "ID" line)

Breakpoints View:
- In multiprocessor platforms, deleting or disabling breakpoints from the 
  breakpoint view or the source window view may not work. It is possible to 
  delete breakpoints from the MPD Console by using the gdb command
  'info breakpoints' to see the current breakpoints and 'delete <number>'
  to delete a specific breakpoint.

Memory View:
- If a memory monitor spans a region with both valid memory and invalid memory 
  the entire view will show as invalid memory.

Source View:
- Breakpoint markers in source file views may have spurious error markers 
  indicating "Breakpoint installation failed". This is due to the CDT 
  behavior of adding breakpoints on all targets, and can be ignored.

Programmers View:
- The Programmers View window does not update automatically when a breakpoint
  is hit. Selecting a different stack entry in the Debug view will cause it
  to update.
- The rbrk and wbrk fields are not functional. In the future these will allow
  eventpoints to be set to cause breaks on reads or writes of a register.

Programmers View events:
- Programmers View events may be managed by entering commands directly in the
  MPD console but are not displayed properly in the breakpoints view, and may
  cause spurious error messages.

A problem with "Clear Breakpoints Status" may be reported when terminating a 
simulation in some situations. This can be safely ignored.

The suspend button does not work when running the Windows 32-bit version on a
64-bit host (i.e. when setup.bat has been run with the -m32 option).
